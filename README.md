# Automotive Vehicle & Control Systems Modeling Portfolio

This repository is a structured portfolio of MATLAB and Simulink projects
focused on automotive vehicle dynamics, EV/HEV powertrains, road load modeling,
drive cycle energy analysis, and control systems.

Each project is self-contained and includes:
- MATLAB scripts
- Simulink models
- Results and plots
- Clear engineering methodology

# Projects

**Project 01 – Road Load Modeling & Coast-Down Validation**
Physics-based road load modeling for an EV (Mahindra BE6) in the absence of EPA/ARAI data,
validated using coast-down simulation and benchmarked against Tesla Model Y and Kia EV6.

**Project 02 – Drive Cycle Energy & Range Analysis *(upcoming)***
Energy consumption and range estimation under EPA and Indian driving cycles.

**Project 03 – EV Powertrain & Motor Control *(upcoming)***
Electric motor, inverter, and longitudinal torque control modeling.
**Project 04 – HEV Energy Management *(upcoming)***
Rule-based and efficiency-optimized power split strategies for hybrid vehicles.
