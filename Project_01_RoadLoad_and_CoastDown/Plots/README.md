This folder contains key simulation results and visualizations generated as part of the road load modeling and validation process. The plots illustrate the vehicle coast-down behavior, road load coefficient identification, and comparative road load performance across different electric vehicles.

Included plots:

BE6 Coast-Down Velocity: Vehicle speed decay over time under zero-drive torque conditions, used to validate longitudinal dynamics and resistance modeling.

Road Load Curve Fit: Identification of road load coefficients (F₀, F₁, F₂) using coast-down data and least-squares fitting.

Road Load Comparison: Comparison of tractive road load versus vehicle speed for Mahindra BE6, Tesla Model Y, and Kia EV6.

These visualizations support the validation of physics-based assumptions and provide insight into how vehicle mass and aerodynamic characteristics influence resistance and energy consumption.
